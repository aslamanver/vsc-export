# VSC Extension Export & Import | VSC-Export

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aslamanver/vsc-export.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aslamanver/vsc-export)

This extension helps you to export all of your extensions installed in VS Code in a simple text file named `vsc-extensions.txt` into your project folder, more than that you can import all the extensions with the latest updated version of the text file `vsc-extensions.txt` using this same extension again when you need it.

Amazing right? 
You can now don't want to host your source code project into Git without the extensions. No worries, just push the `vsc-extensions.txt` file along with your project so when you pull it there is a single command to get all the extensions back to your system.
